Can you recommend Python courses for beginners?,"Okay, I can help with that! Based on your skills and experience, and the courses I have access to, here are a couple of Python courses for beginners that you might find useful:

## Python Basics

**Skills:** Computer Graphics, Debugging, Computer Programming, Programming Principles, Scripting Languages, Python Programming, Data Structures, Pseudocode
**What You Will Learn:** The course description doesn't explicitly list what you will learn in bullet points, but it covers the basics of Python 3, including conditional execution and iteration as control structures, and strings and lists as data structures. You'll program an on-screen Turtle to draw pretty pictures and learn to draw reference diagrams to reason about program executions, which will help build your debugging skills.
**Description:** This course introduces the basics of Python 3, including conditional execution and iteration as control structures, and strings and lists as data structures. You'll program an on-screen Turtle to draw pretty pictures. You'll also learn to draw reference diagrams as a way to reason about program executions, which will help to build up your debugging skills. The course has no prerequisites and covers Chapters 1-9 of the textbook ""Fundamentals of Python Programming."" It's suitable for newcomers to Python programming, those needing a refresher, or those wanting a more in-depth exposition and vocabulary for describing and reasoning about programs. This is the first of five courses in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.
**URL:** https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics

## Practical Python: Start Your Programming Journey

**Skills:** Program Development, Pseudocode, Interactive Design, Algorithms, Python Programming, Debugging, Computer Programming, Game Design
**What You Will Learn:**
*   Read and write code that takes user input and manipulates different kinds of data types (strings, integers, doubles and booleans) and prints results.
*   Read and write code that makes decisions (conditionals), can do random behavior, and involves repetition (while loop).
*   Explain that programming often involves similar strategies to solve problems and provide an example.
*   Plan an outline for a program, translate that plan to code, step through code to check variable values, and recognize parts of an error message.
**Description:** This course teaches you the beginnings of Python programming assuming you are starting with no experience. By the end of this course, you will be able to write your own text adventure game, create a personalized calculator, write a poem, and so much more! This course will also introduce you to a process for planning out your programming projects and ideas on how to fix your code when it is not doing what you want through open-ended assignments.
