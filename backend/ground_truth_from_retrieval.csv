Can you recommend Python courses for beginners?,"Based on the provided documents, I can recommend two Python courses for beginners: ""Python Basics"" and ""Practical Python: Start Your Programming Journey.""

""Python Basics"" introduces the fundamentals of Python 3, covering conditional execution, iteration, strings, and lists. It will help you program an on-screen Turtle to draw pictures and build debugging skills. It has no prerequisites and covers Chapters 1-9 of the textbook ""Fundamentals of Python Programming"" (optional and free). The course is suitable if you are new to Python, need a refresher, or want a more in-depth understanding of basic programming concepts. This course is the first of five courses in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.

""Practical Python: Start Your Programming Journey"" is designed for individuals with no prior programming experience. By the end of this course, you will be able to write your own text adventure game, create a personalized calculator, and write a poem. It introduces a process for planning programming projects and fixing code.","['Course name: Python Basics\n    Skills: Computer Graphics, Debugging, Computer Programming, Programming Principles, Scripting Languages, Python Programming, Data Structures, Pseudocode\n    What you will learn: \n    \n    Description: This course introduces the basics of Python 3, including conditional execution and iteration as control structures, and strings and lists as data structures.
