baseline,What does a Machine Learning Engineer do?,"A Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) sits at the intersection of software engineering, data science, and machine learning research. They are responsible for building, deploying, and maintaining scalable machine learning systems in production.  Essentially, they take the models created by data scientists and turn them into real-world applications.

Here's a breakdown of their responsibilities and key skills:

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Model Deployment and Management:**
    *   **Deployment:**  Taking a trained machine learning model and putting it into a production environment where it can be used to make predictions on real-world data. This involves choosing the right infrastructure (cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP or on-premise servers), containerization (using Docker), and deployment strategies (e.g., A/B testing, shadow deployment).
    *   **Monitoring:**  Continuously tracking the performance of deployed models.  This includes monitoring accuracy, latency, throughput, and resource consumption.  Alerting systems are often set up to notify engineers when models degrade or encounter issues.
    *   **Retraining:**  Developing automated retraining pipelines to update models with new data. This is crucial to maintain model accuracy as the data distribution changes over time (a phenomenon known as ""model drift"").  This often involves setting up triggers for retraining based on performance metrics.
    *   **Version Control:**  Managing different versions of models and code to ensure reproducibility and allow for easy rollback if necessary.  This often involves using tools like Git for code and specialized tools for model versioning (e.g., MLflow, DVC).

*   **Building Scalable and Reliable Infrastructure:**
    *   **Data Pipelines:**  Designing and implementing robust data pipelines to ingest, process, and transform data for model training and inference.  This often involves using big data technologies like Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, and cloud-based data warehousing solutions (e.g., AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery).
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure.  This ensures consistency and reproducibility across different environments (development, staging, production).
    *   **Performance Optimization:**  Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks in machine learning systems. This may involve optimizing code, tuning model parameters, or scaling infrastructure.

*   **Collaboration with Data Scientists and Software Engineers:**
    *   **Bridging the Gap:**  MLEs act as a bridge between data scientists who focus on model development and software engineers who focus on building and maintaining software applications.
    *   **Model Packaging:**  Working with data scientists to package models in a way that is easy to deploy and integrate into existing systems.  This might involve creating APIs or using model serving frameworks.
    *   **Requirements Gathering:**  Understanding the requirements of the business and translating them into technical specifications for machine learning systems.

*   **Experimentation and Evaluation:**
    *   **A/B Testing:**  Designing and implementing A/B tests to compare the performance of different models or features.
    *   **Offline Evaluation:**  Using historical data to evaluate the performance of models before they are deployed to production.

Focus is on learning coding standards, contributing to projects under guidance, and understanding the software development lifecycle.  Experience with languages like C++, Java, JavaScript, or Python is common. (Contexts 3, 4, 5, 7)

2.  **Software Engineer:**  At this level, engineers have gained experience and can work more independently. They are involved in feature development, debugging, and contributing to design discussions.  Experience with distributed systems, cloud services, and specific technologies (like .NET, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes) becomes more valuable. (Contexts 1, 2, 9)

3.  **Software Engineer 2 / Experienced Software Engineer:** This indicates further experience and expertise. They take on more complex tasks, mentor junior engineers, and may specialize in a particular area (e.g., front-end, back-end, AI). They are expected to have a deeper understanding of system architecture and contribute to architectural decisions. (Contexts 6, 8)

4.  **Lead Software Engineer:** This is a senior role that combines technical expertise with leadership responsibilities. Lead Engineers are responsible for designing and developing complex systems, mentoring other engineers, and working with product managers to define technical roadmaps. They possess strong communication and problem-solving skills. (Context 10)

It's important to note that this is a general path, and the specific titles and responsibilities may vary depending on the company and industry. Some engineers may also choose to specialize in areas like AI/ML, full-stack development, or DevOps, which can influence their career trajectory.","['Title: Software Engineer\nJob level: Software Engineer\nWorking type: None\nCompany: VINAI\n\nQualifications & Skills:\nBachelor s Degree in Automotive, Electrical, Communication or Computer Engineering, 2+ years professional experience with Automotive/ Autonomous Driving System or Software Development, 2+ years professional experience with SW development of mathematical concepts as well as algorithms, 5+ years professional work experience with System Linux and/or Linux programming using C++, 5+ years professional work experience with embedded software development for safety critical systems e.g., automotive, aerospace using C++, Model based development skills using SysML and/or UML ideally using Enterprise Architect, Experience in the development of embedded systems in POSIX-based OS, QNX or Classical AUTOSAR, Knowledge of development processes e.g ASPICE, version management, change management, reviews, Awareness of AD industry trends, technologies, competitive products, best practices HW/SW, Experience in SOTIF analysis of Autonomous driving projects in System and/or SW level, Knowledge and/or experience in developing SW applications using Adaptive/Classic AUTOSAR, Experience with Agile software engineering methodology\n\nResponsibilities:\nWork on real projects, meaningful and interesting work, Have a great learning experience with a humble, inspiring team.', 'Title: Software Engineer\nJob level: engineer\nWorking type: fulltime\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nQualifications & Skills:\nBachelor s Degree in Computer Science or related technical discipline with proven experience coding in languages including, but not limited to, C, C++, C , Java, JavaScript, or Python. + OR equivalent experience.
