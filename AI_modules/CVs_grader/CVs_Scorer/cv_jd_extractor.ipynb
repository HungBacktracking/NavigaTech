    "  **IMPORTANT: NO HALLUCINATIONS**\n",
    "  - All **strengths**, **weaknesses**, **keywords_missing**, and any referenced skills or experiences must be verbatim present or missing in the `{resume_text}` through exact (case-insensitive) substring matching. Do **not** infer, paraphrase, or assume synonyms. If a term is not found exactly in the resume text, do not list it.\n",
    "  - Give high detail **strengths**, **weaknesses** and **improvement_advice**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **SCORING GUIDELINES:**\n",
    "  - **Strict scoring rubric:** award full points only for explicit requirements; deduct 50% of a component score for any missing critical skill or experience.\n",
    "  - **No hallucinations:** strengths must be directly present in the resume and relevant to the JD. Any skill or tool not mentioned should not appear in strengths.\n",
    "  **OUTPUT MUST BE EXACT JSON** (no extra text):\n",
    "\n",
    "  **IMPORTANT STRENGTHS RULE:**\n",
    "  Return summarized, concise strengths that meet **both** of the following conditions:\n",
    "  1. The skill, tool, or experience must appear **verbatim** (case-insensitive substring match) in the resume.\n",
    "  2. The same skill or keyword must also appear **verbatim** in the job description.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Instead of listing raw keywords, write a short phrase or sentence that **summarizes** each relevant matching skill or experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Good Example:\n",
    "  - “Experience using Python and SQL for backend development and analytics.”\n",
    "\n",
    "  Bad Example:\n",
    "  - “Python”  \n",
    "  - “AI”  \n",
    "  - “LLM” (if not in JD)\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Rule for Missing or Weak Areas:\n",
    "  - you need always to point out missing and weak areas if found. You also need to provide high value detail advices to improve that missing and weak skills.\n",
